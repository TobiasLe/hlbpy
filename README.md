# hlbpy

hlbpy (high level blender python) is a library intended to make it more convinient to set up scenes in Blender with python. 

I mainly write this library for my myself, to make it easier to create videos for my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/marblescience
Anyway, you are welcome to use the code. Just be aware that it is far from complete, far from well tested and far from well documented.
